            Set a few years after the horrifying events in the critically acclaimed Resident Evil 7 biohazard,
    the all-new storyline begins with Ethan Winters and his wife Mia living peacefully in a new location,
    free from their past nightmares.
    Just as they are building their new life together,
    tragedy befalls them once again.
    When BSAA captain Chris Redfield attacks their home,
    Ethan must once again head into hell to get his kidnapped daughter back.
